# IBM PyTorch Fashion MNIST Project 

This project is part of an IBM deep learning course and focuses on building and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the Fashion-MNIST dataset in PyTorch. It includes models with and without batch normalization, along with training, evaluation, and sample visualization.

## Project Description

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories. This project walks through:

- Dataset transformation and loading
- Custom CNN implementation
- Training using SGD and Cross Entropy Loss
- Batch Normalization variant
- Model evaluation and visualization
